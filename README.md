# What's banditml?

[banditml](https://github.com/banditml/banditml) is a lightweight contextual bandit & reinforcement learning library designed to be used in production Python services. This library is developed by [Bandit ML](https://www.banditml.com) and ex-authors of Facebook's applied reinforcement learning platform, [Reagent](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ReAgent).

Specifically, this repo contains:
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Model implementations
- Model training workflows
- Model serving code for Python services

<b>4</b> feature types supported:
* <b>Numeric:</b> standard floating point features
  * e.g. `{totalCartValue: 39.99}`
* <b>Categorical:</b> low-cardinality discrete features
  * e.g. `{currentlyViewingCategory: "men's jeans"}`
* <b>ID list:</b> high-cardinality discrete features
  * e.g. `{productsInCart: ["productId022", "productId109"...]}`
  * Handled via. learned embedding tables
* <b>"Dense" ID list:</b> high-cardinality discrete features, manually mapped to dense feature vectors
  * e.g `{productId022: [0.5, 1.3, ...], productId109: [1.9, 0.1, ...], ...}`
